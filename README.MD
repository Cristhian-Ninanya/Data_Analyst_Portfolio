# **Data Analyst Portfolio**

Welcome,

Here you will find various data analysis projects, demonstrating my proficiency in tools like Python and SQL. While I utilized MySQL in these instances, the projects can be replicated in other SQL databases such as PostgresSQL, Oracle, Amazon RDS, MariaDB, and more.

Visit this [link](https://cristhian-ninanya.blogspot.com/) for a detailed overview of each project.

To recreate these projects, it's recommended to install the libraries outlined in the requirements file.
